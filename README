This project has the purpose to port the Jerklib Java Library (an IRC library) to work with Google WebToolkit.

Jerklib_gwt will be used in a gwt irc client, cakeIRC, but can be useful for other projects too.

All the communication is done using raw HTML5 websockets, and it  also includes a simple python websocket proxy server.
