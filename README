This project has the purpose to port the Jerklib Java Library (an IRC library) to Google WebToolkit.

See all Jerklib documentation in
http://jerklib.sourceforge.net/

Jerklib_gwt will be used in a gwt irc client, cakeIRC, but can be useful for other projects too.

All the communication is done using raw HTML5 websockets. To allow the access to IRC networks, it is necessary to use a websockets proxy. A simple one was developed in python and is included on the server directory.

Thanks to the jerklib developers for the very well structured library :)
