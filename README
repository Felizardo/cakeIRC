=== Objective ===
Make an IRC client that delivers the best user experience. It should be simple as cake. 

=== Ideas ====
Use: GWT and comet.

-> The program focus should be in the channels, not in servers.
-> Easy channel search with IRC++
-> Option to enter in channels at different networks without needing to split all the interface.
-> Allow users to have avatars, send images, personalize the channel with IRC++
-> Integrate with facebook, twitter etc.
-> Automate and integrate with the GUI services like Nickserver, Chanserver, Memoserver and etc.
