=== Objective ===
Make an IRC client that delivers the best user experience. It should be simple as cake. 

=== Ideas ====
Use: GWT and socket.io.

-> The program focus should be in the channels, not in servers.
-> Easy channel search with IRC++
-> Option to enter in channels at different networks without needing to split all the interface.
-> Allow users to have avatars, send images, personalize the channel with IRC++
-> Integrate with facebook, twitter etc.
-> Automate and integrate with the GUI services like Nickserver, Chanserver, Memoserver and etc.

=== RESEARCH ===

=== OTHER WEB CLIENTS ===

-> Kiwi IRC (Seems to use socket.io)
https://github.com/prawnsalad/KiwiIRC/

-> Subway
Very neat web client. Seems to be the closest of what I expect from cakeIRC so far.

-> QWebIRC
Simple web client. It is the standard for quakenet and freenode.

-> OTHERS webchats (not necessary IRC)
Kandan, Ballons.io seems to have all features I want, but it doesn't connect to IRC.

=== LIBRARY ===
Main framework: GWT

-> gwt-comet
GWT SERVER and CLIENT side comet implementation
https://code.google.com/p/gwt-comet/

-> gwt-ws
GWT SERVER and CLIENT side WEBSOCKET implementation
https://code.google.com/p/gwt-ws/

-> node-irc
SERVER-SIDE Javascript library to IRC protocol.
https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc

-> socket.io
Javascript SERVER and CLIENT-SIDE librry for emulating sockets.
http://socket.io/

=== DESIGN DECISIONS ===
-> Use MVC, and create a special layer to the connection (socket etc.)

-> It seems that everybody likes to log all conversations in a channel. This can be done as an optional plugin to our application...
