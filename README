=== Objective ===
Make an IRC client that delivers the best user experience. It should be simple as cake. 

=== Ideas ====
Use: GWT and socket.io.

-> The program focus should be in the channels, not in servers.
-> Easy channel search with IRC++
-> Option to enter in channels at different networks without needing to split all the interface.
-> Allow users to have avatars, send images, personalize the channel with IRC++
-> Integrate with facebook, twitter etc.
-> Automate and integrate with the GUI services like Nickserver, Chanserver, Memoserver and etc.

=== RESEARCH ===

=== OTHER WEB CLIENTS ===

-> Kiwi IRC (Seems to use socket.io)
https://github.com/prawnsalad/KiwiIRC/

-> Subway
Very neat web client. Seems to be the closest of what I expect from cakeIRC so far.

-> QWebIRC
Simple web client. It is the standard for quakenet and freenode.

-> OTHERS webchats (not necessary IRC)
Kandan, Ballons.io seems to have all features I want, but it doesn't connect to IRC.

=== LIBRARY ===
GUI framework: GWT

Interfacing with server: 
Using pure websockets wrapper. I think websockets is mature enough to use on its own.

Server-side:
Thinking about using python because its fun. 
This will allow the interface between server and client as clear as possible (NO JAVA RPC CALLS)
Websockets server implementation:
https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python/


=== DESIGN DECISIONS ===
-> Use MVC, and create a special layer to the connection (socket etc.)

-> It seems that everybody likes to log all conversations in a channel. This will be implemented in the standalone version.
